# RNA-ERGY

This program contains various scripts for creating and training an objective function on a dataset of known (experimentally determined) 3D RNA structures. The objective function estimates the Gibbs free energy of a given structure, which can be used to evaluate and compare the stability of predicted RNA structures. In addition, this program includes scripts for generating scoring profiles, which plot the estimated Gibbs free energy as a function of interatomic distances. With these tools, you can optimize the 3D structure of RNA molecules and gain insights into their stability and function
